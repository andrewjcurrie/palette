# Panic Palette Theme for Sublime Text
This theme is a recreation of the Palette theme from Panic's Coda application for Sublime Text.

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
	
Now you can open Sublime Text again. Change to the new theme with the following menu options:

	Sublime Text --> Preferences --> Color Scheme --> User -->Panic Palette
